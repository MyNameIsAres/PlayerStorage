# PlayerStorage

The Playerstorage plugin is a plugin that is part of a larger project for my upcoming server. Crucial classes, files and credentials are currently hidden.
The Laravel application supporting this will be online after a code clean up. 

The third feature of this plugin is a fluent API to perform database queries. That repository will be linked once it is published.
